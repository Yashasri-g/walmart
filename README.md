# Walmart Companion AI

## Problem Statement

Walmart’s retail ecosystem faces several challenges:
- **Demand forecasting gaps** leading to unexpected stockouts.
- **Inefficient checkout flows** causing long lines and slow processing.
- **Generic product recommendations** that don’t match individual shopper needs.
- **Unreliable delivery visibility** resulting in customer frustration.
- **Fragmented returns** processes that are hard to navigate.
- **Low-income shoppers** often lack clear, trusted guidance for healthier, more affordable, and sustainable choices.

These gaps weaken customer trust, increase churn, and limit Walmart’s potential for a truly data-driven, personalized retail experience.
